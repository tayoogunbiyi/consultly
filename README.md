# Consultly - CPE 502 Project, Database Management

## What is Consultly?

[Consultly](https://consultly.herokuapp.com) is a web application that enables a consulting firm to provides services in a variety of fields or industries to companies and businesses. 

Potential clients or companies from different industries would be able to view the services offered by the consulting firm, register their companies on the website, book consultations, and view their consultation reports. 

Admin employees of the consulting firm would be able to sign in to the website, view the status of pending consultations booked by companies,  and upload the consultation reports of companies which includes the results from their consultation.

The project was built using CodeIgniter Version 4, a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
